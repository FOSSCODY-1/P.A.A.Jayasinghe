A visualization system for 3 sorting algorithms 

Description

      1-Insertion Sort
      2-Selection Sort
      3-Bubble Sort
      
     Above sorting techniques are implimented using c.Comments will be usefull to understand the code.Output is userfriendly and give clear description to how it happens step by step.

  Installing
  
           Dev C++
               * step 1-Go to bloodshed.net. 
               * step 2-On the left side of the screen, under "Site Map", click "Download".
               * step 3-At the top of the page there will be a link for Dev-C++. Click on this link.
               * step 4-Download the latest version of Dev-C++ by clicking on "Go to Download Page" on the first version of Dev-C++ that you see at the top of the window. This link is next to the "Downloads:" section.
               * step 5-Scroll down the new page to the "Downloads" section, right underneath the PayPal link (Don't worry, you don't have to pay!).
